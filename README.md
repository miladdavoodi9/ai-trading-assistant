# AI Trading Assistant & Researcher

> Personal AI-powered trading research system built on [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). Connects to your Schwab account, knows your actual positions and cost basis, and delivers personalized profit-taking and income guidance — all from your terminal.

---

## What This Is

A private, self-hosted trading research system that combines:

- **Your real portfolio** — Schwab CSV integration loads your actual positions, cost basis, unrealized gains, and cash balances
- **16 Claude Code skills** — quick snapshots, full 5-agent analyses, options strategy, earnings previews, sector rotation, and more
- **Personalized guidance** — profit-taking recommendations with specific share counts and tax notes, income optimization, covered call opportunities
- **Zero brokerage connections** — reads a CSV export you control; never touches your account directly

This is a research and analysis tool. It does not execute trades, manage money, or provide financial advice.

## Schwab Integration

The system reads a positions CSV you export directly from Schwab. No API keys. No brokerage connection. You control the data.

### Export Steps

1. Log in to Schwab → **Accounts** tab → **Positions**
2. Click the **Export** icon (top-right, page with down-arrow)
3. Save the CSV file
4. Drop it into `portfolio/input/`
5. Run the parser:

```bash
python parse_schwab.py
```

This generates `portfolio/portfolio.json` — the structured data file all skills read from. From that point, every `/trade guidance` and `/trade portfolio` run uses your actual positions.

## Privacy & Security

- `portfolio/input/` is gitignored — your CSV exports never leave your machine
- `portfolio/portfolio.json` is gitignored — your positions and cost basis stay local
- No API connections to Schwab or any brokerage
- No data leaves your environment except standard Claude API calls for analysis

## Coming Soon

### 🪙 Crypto Tab — Coinbase Integration
Add a dedicated **Crypto** tab alongside the existing Stocks tab. Connect directly to the Coinbase API to pull live BTC, ETH, and altcoin balances, cost basis, and P&L — the same way Schwab CSVs power the Stocks tab today. Cold wallet balances (BTC/ETH held in hardware wallets) can be added manually or imported, then consolidated with Coinbase into a single net worth view across all assets.

**Planned features:**
- Coinbase OAuth or API key integration
- Manual cold wallet address entry (read-only balance lookup via public blockchain)
- Crypto-specific agents: on-chain sentiment, fear & greed index, whale activity, DeFi yield opportunities
- Unified total net worth bar across Stocks + Crypto tabs

---

### 🌐 Local Network Hosting — Access from Any Device
Host the dashboard on your Windows PC so it's reachable from your MacBook (or phone) when you're on the same Wi-Fi — or anywhere via a secure tunnel when traveling.

**Planned features:**
- Auto-detect local IP and bind to `0.0.0.0` on startup
- Optional password protection for the dashboard
- `ngrok` or Cloudflare Tunnel integration for secure remote access from MacBook while traveling
- QR code printed at startup for instant mobile access
